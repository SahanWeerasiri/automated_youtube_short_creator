# README

## Project Overview

This project is a Python application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
- .env
- .gitignore
- readme_creator.py
```

## Project Details

This project contains the following files:

- readme_creator.py
### readme_creator.py
This Python script, `readme_generator.py`, automates the creation of a README.md file for a given project directory.  It leverages the Gemini API to generate summaries of the Python files within the project.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Setup:**
   - Loads environment variables (specifically the `GEMINI_API_KEY`) from a `.env` file using `dotenv`.
   - Defines the `readme_generator` function that handles the core logic.

2. **README Existence Check:**
   - Before generating a new README, it verifies if one already exists. If `README.md` is present, it prints a message and exits.

3. **File Listing and Filtering:**
   - Gets a list of all files in the specified directory.
   - Filters this list to include only Python files (files ending with `.py`).
   - If no Python files are found, it prints a message and exits.

4. **README Creation and Content Population:**
   - Creates a `README.md` file in write mode (`"w"`).
   - Writes basic project information, including an overview, project structure, and a list of files.

5. **Gemini API Integration for Code Summarization:**
   - Iterates through each identified Python file.
   - Reads the content of each Python file.
   - Sends a request to the Gemini API to generate a summary of the code.
     - The request includes the code content and a prompt asking for a summary.
     - Handles potential errors from the API request (status codes other than 200).
   - Parses the JSON response from the API to extract the generated summary.
   - Writes the summary of each file into the `README.md` file under the appropriate section.

6. **Git Integration (Version Control):**
   - Uses `subprocess.run` to execute Git commands to add the newly created/updated `README.md` to the staging area (`git add ./README.md`) and then commits the changes with a message (`git commit -m "Updated README.md"`).

7. **Main Execution Block:**
   - Gets the target directory from the command-line arguments (if provided). If no argument is given, it defaults to the current working directory.
   - Stores current directory with `pwd = os.getcwd()`
   - Changes directory using `os.chdir(directory)`
   - Calls the `readme_generator` function to create the README file.
   - Changes back to original directory with `os.chdir(pwd)`
   - Prints a success message.

In essence, the script automates the process of creating a basic README file for a Python project, including a file listing and summaries of the Python code generated by the Gemini API, then stages and commits this change with git. It handles errors and avoids overwriting existing README files.
